write a Hidden Markov Model part-of-speech tagger for Italian, Japanese, and a surprise language.
The training data are provided tokenized and tagged; the test data will be provided tokenized, and your tagger will add the tags. 
The assignment will be graded based on the performance of your tagger, that is how well it performs on unseen test data compared to the performance of a reference tagger.

A set of training and development data is available as a compressed ZIP archive on Blackboard. The uncompressed archive contains the following files:

Two files (one Italian, one Japanese) with tagged training data in the word/TAG format, with words separated by spaces and each sentence on a new line.

Two files (one Italian, one Japanese) with untagged development data, with words separated by spaces and each sentence on a new line.

Two files (one Italian, one Japanese) with tagged development data in the word/TAG format, with words separated by spaces and each sentence on a new line, to serve as an answer key.

A readme/license file (which you wonâ€™t need for the exercise).

The grading script will train your model on all of the tagged training and development data (separately for Italian and Japanese), and test the model on unseen data in a similar format. The grading script will do the same for the surprise language, for which all of the training, development and test data are unseen.
